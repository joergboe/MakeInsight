# Rules with Grouped Targets

# see: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Multiple-Rules

# Unlike independent targets, a grouped target rule must include a recipe. However, targets that are 
# members of a grouped target may also appear in independent target rule definitions that do not have recipes.

# Usage  : make -f 49_1_must_have_recipes.mk
#          49_1_must_have_recipes.mk:21: *** grouped targets must provide a recipe.  Stop.
